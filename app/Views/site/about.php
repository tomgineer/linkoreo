        <h1>The Story of My Platform</h1>

        <img src="<?=path_gfx().'about.webp'?>">

        <p>Once upon a time - somewhere around the year 2010 - a humble little web page came to life. It wasn’t fancy, it didn’t run on any big, shiny platform, and it certainly didn’t have AI, frameworks, or those weird cookie popups that chase you around the internet. Nope. It was just me, a text editor, and a static HTML page.</p>

        <p>That page was simple. Pure. Honest. It had one job: to host all my links in one place - a personal little corner of the web that traveled with me everywhere I went. Over the years, it became more than just a bunch of links; it became a quiet digital companion, always ready to serve, never asking for updates, and definitely not built on someone else’s platform. It was mine - entirely.</p>

        <p>Of course, time marched on. The web evolved, browsers got faster, and suddenly everyone started talking about frameworks, responsive layouts, and dark mode. My old HTML page looked like it was still running Windows XP. It deserved better. After all, I had used it thousands of times - literally - and it had never once complained.</p>

        <p>So I rolled up my sleeves and gave it the upgrade it deserved. Now, this brand-new version stands proudly on its own backend, dressed in TailwindCSS - a modern suit that makes it sleek, flexible, and a little bit smug. I even added some handy tools that I use every day, because why not? If you’re going to rebuild your digital home, you might as well add a coffee machine.</p>

        <p>And here it is - my old companion, reborn, faster, sharper, and prettier than ever. Some people rebuild cars, others restore old guitars... Me? I rewrote my link platform.</p>

        <p>Because when you love something that much - you don’t let it fade into history. You give it a fresh coat of code and <strong>make it shine again</strong>.</p>
