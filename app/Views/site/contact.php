        <h1>So... How Do You Contact Me?</h1>

        <img src="<?=path_gfx().'contact.webp'?>">

        <p>
            This is the part of the website where I’m supposed to impress you with a long list of
            ways to reach me: social networks, messenger apps, community servers, secret underground
            communication channels… you know, the usual.
        </p>

        <p>
            Unfortunately, this is also the part where reality shows up, looks at my life,
            and starts laughing.
        </p>

        <h2>Step 1: Social Media (a very short story)</h2>

        <p>
            At first, I thought: <em>“Easy. I’ll just put all my social media links here.”</em><br>
            Instagram, X (formerly Twitter, formerly a nice place), Facebook, LinkedIn, maybe even TikTok
            if I wanted to pretend I’m still trendy.
        </p>

        <p>
            There was only one tiny problem: I don’t actually have social media.
        </p>

        <p>
            No Instagram influencer life. No motivational LinkedIn posts. No carefully curated
            photos of coffee with deep philosophical captions. Just… nothing. A glorious digital
            silence. So the whole “Follow me on all the usual platforms!” section
            very quickly turned into “Well, that’s awkward.”
        </p>

        <h2>Step 2: Community &amp; Chat Apps (plot twist: also no)</h2>

        <p>
            Then I thought: <em>“Okay, never mind social media, I’ll put my Discord server, maybe
                a Telegram, a Slack workspace… something cool and modern.”</em>
        </p>

        <p>
            Spoiler: I don’t have those either.
        </p>

        <p>
            There is no Discord server with my name on it, no Telegram channel, no Slack community.
            If you’re imagining a vibrant online hub full of people discussing important topics and
            memes in my honor… please keep imagining, because it exists only in theory.
        </p>

        <p>
            So that whole idea also went straight into the digital trash bin, right next to my
            nonexistent social media presence.
        </p>

        <h2>Step 3: Email – the illusion of hope</h2>

        <p>
            At this point I tried to be practical: <em>“Fine. I’ll just share an email address. Old school.
                Reliable. Professional.”</em>
        </p>

        <p>
            Now, technically, I do have email addresses. Several, in fact. A truly impressive collection,
            if owning multiple inboxes you never open counts as an achievement.
        </p>

        <p>
            The problem is that I don’t really read them. Not consistently. Not in a way that
            could be described as “useful for communication.” If email was a plant, all my inboxes
            would be brown, dry, and emotionally neglected.
        </p>

        <p>
            So while I could put an email here like:
            <br>
            <code>you[at]example[dot]com</code>
            <br>
            …the honest truth is that you might write a lovely message, pour your heart out, hit send,
            and then watch it vanish into the void, never to be seen again. Not exactly the friendly
            contact experience I’m aiming for.
        </p>

        <h2>Step 4: The Phone (a horror story)</h2>

        <p>
            Next idea: <em>“Let’s just put my phone number. I always have my phone on me.
                Problem solved!”</em>
        </p>

        <p>
            And I do answer my phone. I really do. The issue is that my phone also rings
            about 20 times a day with calls from professional scammers, telemarketers, and
            mysterious “customer service” departments I never signed up for.
        </p>

        <p>
            After a while, every unknown number starts to feel like a mini jump scare.
            You stare at the screen, wondering:
            <em>“Is this a real human being who wants to talk to me, or someone who wants
                to sell me an extended warranty for a car I don’t own?”</em>
        </p>

        <p>
            So if I put my phone number here, there’s a high chance that your call will be
            bravely sacrificed to the great god of “I’m not answering that.”
        </p>

        <h2>So… now what?</h2>

        <p>
            At this stage, you might be wondering how anyone talks to me at all.
            Excellent question. I’m starting to wonder that, too.
        </p>

        <p>
            Here’s the honest situation:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>No social media links – because I have none.</li>
            <li>No Discord, Telegram, or anything fancy – also none.</li>
            <li>Emails exist, but mostly as decoration.</li>
            <li>Phone calls exist, but are buried under a mountain of scammers.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            If this was a normal contact page, this is where you’d see a big shiny button saying
            “Contact Me Now!” with at least three different options.
        </p>

        <p>
            Instead, you get this story – which, to be fair, is probably more honest than half the
            contact pages on the internet.
        </p>

        <h2>The (nonexistent) solution</h2>

        <p>
            I could pretend there’s a secret link hidden somewhere here, or a mysterious
            form that opens only under a full moon, but no there really isn’t.
        </p>

        <p>
            There’s no contact form, no email link, no “click here to reach me.” Nothing.
            This page exists purely as a monument to my impressive inaccessibility.
        </p>

        <p>
            So if you were hoping to contact me… I admire your optimism. Truly.
            But for now, you’ll just have to enjoy the peaceful silence of not doing that.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> You can’t contact me. Not by phone, not by email, not by carrier pigeon.
            Consider this the most relaxing contact page you’ll ever visit.</p>
